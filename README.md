# Readme Generator

## Description

Manually formatting a readme for homework and projects is repetitive and I need to cement node.js concepts in my brain, so this is an application that generates a readme based on user inputs in the console and kills two birds with one stone. 

## Table of Contents
If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
